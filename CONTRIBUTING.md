# Contributing to Solid Developer Tools

:+1::tada: Thank you for checking out the project and wanting to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following document is a _(work in progress)_ guide for contributing to Solid Developer Tools. It is a work in progress, so please feel free to suggest changes and improvements. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the [Solid Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solidjs). (We have a #solid-devtools channel there)

## Tooling

[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/ and [`eslint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) — that's it.

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management. If you don't have it installed, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.

If this is your first time pulling the repository onto a local branch, then run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies and `pnpm build` to build all the packages — this is important because all of the packages are linked together, using the `pnpm` workspace feature. If you don't do this, you will get errors when trying to run the project.

You should reinstall the dependencies and rebuild the packages whenever you pull from the main branch. This is because the dependencies and packages may have changed. If you experience any issues, try removing the `node_modules` folder (`rm -Force -Recurse .\node_modules\` or `rm -rf node_modules/`) and repeating the steps above.

The code is formatted with prettier. You can use it if you want, or not, it's up to you because the code get's formatted automatically by a github action. If you want to use it, you can run `pnpm format` to format the code.

If you want to run the E2E tests, you need to install the dependencies by running `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium` _(or `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`)_, then run `pnpm test:e2e`.

## Operating System

I'm working on a linux machine right now, but everything should be wokking the same way regardless of OS. Please make an issue if it's not.

Alternatively, if something is off, I recommend using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) or [Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) for development. Both of them are free for oss projects like this one and will give you a stable development environment.

## CLI Commands

Here is a list of the commands you can run in the project:

### DEV

#### `pnpm dev:ext` — Run the [extension](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools/tree/main/extension#readme) in development mode.

Important if you want to work on the chrome extension. _(The script may fail sometimes after changes, so keep an eye on the console, and restart it if neccessary)_

#### `pnpm dev`

**Builds all of the client packages in the watch mode.** Those are the packages that run in the users browser. (client, shared, locator, debugger, frontend, overlay)

#### `pnpm dev:sandbox` — Opens the [sandbox](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools/tree/main/examples/sandbox) playground with overlay component

#### `pnpm dev:sandbox:ext` — Opens the [sandbox](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools/tree/main/examples/sandbox) playground with extension client

### TEST

#### `pnpm build` — Builds all packages

#### `pnpm test:unit` — Runs all unit tests

#### `pnpm test:types` — Checks types with tsc

#### `pnpm test:lint` — Lints code with eslint

#### `pnpm test:e2e` - Runs all the E2E tests _(needs playwright deps installed)_

#### `pnpm build-test` — Runs both the build and all the tests

Watchout, `build-test` may freeze your computer a bit :)

When you make a PR, the CI will run all of these commands, so you don't have to worry about it.

### Changeset

This project uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage package versions. If you want to make a change to a package, you can run `pnpm changeset` and it will guide you through the process.

## Developing the extension

1. Run `pnpm dev:ext` to start the extension in development mode

2. Open the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page

3. Enable the developer mode

4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the `extension/dist/chrome` directory (or `extension/dist/firefox` if you are using firefox)

5. The extendion is now loaded and ready to go! Now run open any page with Solid and you should be able to open the devtools.
